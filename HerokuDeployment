Step-by-Step Guide to Deploy a Meteor 3.0.4 App to Heroku

1. Create a Heroku App
   Log in to your Heroku account and create a new app.

2. Connect Your GitHub Repository
   - Navigate to the Deploy section of your Heroku app dashboard.  
   - Under the Deployment method, select GitHub and connect your repository.  
   - (Optional) Enable automatic deployment for continuous updates.

3. Add the Buildpack
   - Go to the Settings section of your Heroku app.  
   - Under Buildpacks, add:  
     ```
     https://github.com/AdmitHub/meteor-buildpack-horse.git
     ```

4. Set Config Vars
   - Still in the Settings section, add the following environment variables under Config Vars:  
     - `MONGOLAB_URI`  
     - `MONGO_URL`  
     - `ROOT_URL`: Set this to your app's URL in the format:  
       ```
       https://[your-app-name].herokuapp.com/
       ```  
     - Ensure that `MONGO_URL` is identical to `MONGOLAB_URI`.

5. Deploy the App
   - Return to the Deploy section of your Heroku app dashboard.  
   - Scroll down to Manual Deploy, select the desired branch, and click Deploy Branch.  

Your Meteor app should now be live on Heroku!
